in the past year. His contributions go beyond &quot;fundamental&quot;.
His initiative and tendency to strive for quality show brightly
in his work for the project and its more than half a million regular users</p>
<div class="media-heading">-- Paul Irish, Google Chrome</div></div></div><div class="media media--recommendation"><div class="pull-left media-object-container" href="#"><img class="media-object" src="http://github.com/desandro.png?size=200" /></div><div class="media-body"><p>With his contributions to Bower open source project over the past year,
I&#39;ve been delighted to work with Adam. He stepped into a messy situation,
and did plenty of dirty work to get the project back on track.</p>

<p>He&#39;s got the technical ability, submitting plenty of quality code revisions.
He has a great project management skills, working though issue lists.
In short, Adam gets things done.</p>
<div class="media-heading">-- David DeSandro, Twitter</div></div></div><div class="media media--recommendation"><div class="pull-left media-object-container" href="#"><img class="media-object" src="http://github.com/teamon.png?size=200" /></div><div class="media-body"><p>Adam is definitely an extraordinary developer that not only has a lot of great ideas but what&#39;s even more important the persistence to make them happen. If if wasn&#39;t for Adam the rails-assets.org project wouldn&#39;t be such a success. He took something that started as an idea into solid product used by many Rails teams around the world.</p>

<p>Adam is a must-have person in any team - you can be sure that when he is around your ideas will not pass unquestioned.</p>

<p>Good-enough is never good enough. Adam will always try to dig deeper into a problem and solve it in the best way possible.</p>
<div class="media-heading">-- Tymon Tobolski, CTO of Monterail.com</div></div></div><div class="media media--recommendation"><div class="pull-left media-object-container" href="#"><img class="media-object" src="https://github.com/szymo.png?size=200" /></div><div class="media-body"><p>Single-hearted problem solver — that’s Adam. He was a core member of our team for 3 years, during that time he set some of our highest and most regarded standards (such as our official guidelines) and processes. Always questioned the status quo and inspired everyone around to do so. He actively consulted in almost all areas of our organization bringing bold opinions and fresh insights. You could always tell if Adam was a part of a project — all stakeholders would notice his through and through decisions and pushing the technical boundaries. He left an immersive footprint on all of us and will be incredibly missed. However we are happy that the open source community has just gained a wholehearted individual and a true expert.</p>
<div class="media-heading">-- Szymon Boniecki, Co-owner of Monterail.com</div></div></div><div class="media media--recommendation"><div class="pull-left media-object-container" href="#"><img class="media-object" src="https://github.com/bartoszpietrzak.png?size=200" /></div><div class="media-body"><p>Adam is a responsible and very neatly organized developer.</p>

<p>One of the biggest additional values is his grasp of everything inside and around the development process - be it understanding the business around the software or shaping the development process that suits the project best.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been a crucial part of Monterail&#39;s progress.</p>
<div class="media-heading">-- Bartosz Pietrzak, Co-Owner of Monterail.com</div></div></div><div class="media media--recommendation"><div class="pull-left media-object-container" href="#"><img class="media-object" src="https://github.com/sainejob.png?size=200" /></div><div class="media-body"><p>Adam is an expert in several of our key technologies at Ruvixx. He has helped us develop our core architecture with Ruby on Rails and AngularJS and provided invaluable help when we needed it. I would recommend Adam to anyone with a technical challenge at hand. He&#39;s always willing to go the extra mile to reach the optimal solution.</p>

I owe him a lot - he was my mentor in Monterail and he basically introduced me (with success) to the world of Ruby on Rails. His strong engagement in Open Source Projects is the best proof that development is his passion.</p>

<p>If you look for someone who has outstanding knowledge, writes beautiful code and gets things done - that definitely sounds like him.</p>

including some open-source projects. He’s one of the most clever
developers and out-of-the-box thinkers I’ve had the pleasure to
work with and learn from.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a developer with fresh approach to software
who can share knowledge and make your company stand out at the open-source
field, it would be unwise not to give Adam a shot.</p>
